title: Designing Operating Models for Volatile Markets
excerpt: Three plays for sustaining performance when disruption is constant
---

Resilience is no longer a bolt-on. It must be designed into the operating model
from the start. Executives can accelerate readiness by focusing on three plays:

1. **Signal intelligence.** Build sensing layers that fuse market, risk, and
   customer data into a single source of truth for real-time decisions.
2. **Modular ways of working.** Stand up empowered squads with clear charters,
   adaptive funding models, and transparent metrics.
3. **Leadership rituals.** Reinforce shared accountability through retrospectives,
   learning forums, and scenario sprints that keep teams aligned.

A resilient operating model is the foundation for seizing opportunity even when
conditions shift without warning.
