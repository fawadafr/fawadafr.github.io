Platform engineering represents the evolution of DevOps, focusing on building
self-service internal developer platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity.

## Core Principles

1. **Developer self-service**: Enable teams to provision infrastructure without tickets
2. **Golden paths**: Provide opinionated, secure, pre-approved workflows
3. **Platform as product**: Treat internal platforms with product thinking

## Key Components

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation
- **CI/CD pipelines**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Service catalogs**: Backstage, Port, Internal developer portals

Platform engineering reduces time-to-production while maintaining governance and security.
