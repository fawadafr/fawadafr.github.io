Scaling engineering organizations requires intentional culture design. Here's what works:

## Culture Framework

1. **Document values early**: Write down principles before hitting 50 engineers
2. **Ritualize feedback**: Weekly retros, monthly 360s, quarterly culture surveys
3. **Invest in onboarding**: 2-week structured programs pay massive dividends

## Common Pitfalls

- Hiring for skills over values alignment
- Neglecting documentation and knowledge transfer
- Losing focus on developer experience

The companies that scale successfully treat culture as engineering infrastructure.
