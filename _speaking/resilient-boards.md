subtitle: Keynote | Global Board Leaders Forum
summary: A pragmatic roadmap for boards to stay ahead of systemic risk.
---

In this keynote, Farida partners with board directors to:

1. Assess the maturity of resilience practices across strategy, culture, and
   operating models.
2. Build scenario and signal-monitoring disciplines that surface risk early.
3. Embed inclusive decision-making norms that accelerate high-quality responses.

**Ideal Audience:** Board directors, chief risk officers, governance leaders.

**Outcomes:** Participants leave with a resilience dashboard template, a
practical guide for crisis simulations, and a playbook for aligning leadership
behaviors with enterprise resilience goals.
