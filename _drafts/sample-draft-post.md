This is a sample draft post demonstrating the drafts workflow.

## Key Principles

When scaling engineering teams, focus on these core principles:

1. **Hire for values alignment first, skills second**
   - Cultural fit ensures long-term success
   - Technical skills can be taught, values cannot

2. **Establish clear communication patterns early**
   - Define team rituals and ceremonies
   - Create feedback loops at multiple levels

3. **Invest in onboarding and documentation**
   - Reduce time-to-productivity for new hires
   - Build institutional knowledge that scales

## Draft Notes

- [ ] Add specific examples from previous roles
- [ ] Include metrics on team growth and productivity
- [ ] Add section on remote/hybrid team dynamics
- [ ] Review and refine conclusion
